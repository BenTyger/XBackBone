+ Navigate to the webspace root (ex. `http://example.com/xbackbone`, this should auto redirect your browser to the install page `http://example.com/xbackbone/install/`)
+ Follow the instructions.

### Manual installation

+ Extract the release zip to your document root.
+ Copy and edit the config file:
```sh
cp config.example.php config.php && nano config.php
```
By default, XBackBone will use Sqlite3 as DB engine, and a `storage` dir in the main directory. You can leave these settings unchanged for a simple personal installation.
You must set the `base_url`, or remove it for get dynamically the url from request (not recommended).

```php
return [
	'base_url' => 'https://example.com', // no trailing slash
	'storage_dir' => 'storage',
	'db' => [
		'connection' => 'sqlite',
		'dsn' => 'resources/database/xbackbone.db',
		'username' => null, // username and password not needed for sqlite
		'password' => null,
	]
];
```
+ Finally, run the migrate script to setup the database

```sh
php bin/migrate --install
```
+ Now just login with `admin/admin`, **be sure to change these credentials after your first login**.

#### Changing themes
XBackBone supports all [bootswatch.com](https://bootswatch.com/) themes.

From the web UI:
+ Navigate to the web interface as admin -> System Menu -> Choose a theme from the dropdown.

From the CLI:
+ Run the command `php bin/theme` to see the available themes.
+ Use the same command with the argument name (`php bin/theme <THEME-NAME>`) to choose a theme.
+ If you want to revert back to the original bootstrap theme, run the command `php bin/theme default`.

*Clear the browser cache once you have applied.*

```php
return array(
    'app_name' => 'This line will overwrite "XBackBone"',
    ...
);
```

## How to update

+ Click the update button.
+ Done.


#### Docker deployment
+ [Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/pe46dro/xbackbone-docker)

## ShareX Configuration
Once you are logged in, just go in your profile settings and download the ShareX config file for your account.

## Notes
If you do not use Apache, or the Apache `.htaccess` is not enabled, set your web server so that the `static/` folder is the only one accessible from the outside, otherwise even private uploads and logs will be accessible!
The NGINX configuration should be something like this:
```
# nginx configuration

location /app {
  return 403;
}

location /bin {
  return 403;
}

location /bootstrap {
  return 403;
}

location /resources {
  return 403;
}

location /storage {
  return 403;
}

location /vendor {
  return 403;
}

location /logs {
  return 403;
}

autoindex off;

location / {
  if (!-e $request_filename){
    rewrite ^(.*)$ /index.php break;
  }
}
```
